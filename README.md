# Workshop-IoTFuse2018

This project was presented by [Lab 651](http://lab651.com) at the workshop series held as part of the [IoTFuse:Conference 2018](http://iotfuse.com). 


## Using Machine Learning to Classify Data From the Physical World

### LEARNING OBJECTIVE

Data Science, Machine Learning & Mobile Application Development!

### HOW THIS FITS INTO IOT

Sensors are able to record data at an alarmingly fast state. We will need applications both on the factory floor and in the cloud to recognize and classify when machinery is not functioning properly and take corrective action. This workshop will demonstrate the collection of data from sensors and machine learning to classify the data itâ€™s receiving.

### WHAT ATTENDEES DID

Code a native mobile application using React Native, send data to an Amazon Web Services instance to collaboratively help the system train the data and then together as a group us AWS ML start running predictions on new data being received.

### WHAT ATTENDEES BRING

Laptop & Smartphone

### KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED

Basic understanding of data being sent over the internet to a cloud-based endpoint.

### PRE-CLASS SETUP

Xcode if wanting to build for iOS, Android Studio if wanting to build for Android. Optional: AWS CLI tools.

### WHAT ATTENDEES RECEIVE

Source code for mobile application and ingestion of data and machine learning in AWS.

### LINKS & READING MATERIAL

* Android Studio
* AWS CLI
